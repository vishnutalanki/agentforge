# AgentForge
Build faster and smarter AI agents now! Open-source AI agent framework.

## What is AgentForge?

AgentForge is a fast and simple modular framework to design, test, and deploy AI agents, multi-agent systems, and RAGs. 

### Features:
- Modular framework to build and manage AI agents with ease.
- Metadata management for agent governance and tool usage.
- Dynamic LLM benchmarking and selection for optimal performance.
- Support for custom personas and dynamic agent attributes.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) support.

### Core Capabilities

#### Agent Governance and Metadata Management
- Build metadata frameworks in seconds.
- Document agents, interactions, and tool usage.
- Store and manage metadata for agents, tools, and RAG workflows.

#### Model Benchmarking
- Continuously test and benchmark LLMs for specific tasks.
- Dynamically select the best LLMs for each agent.
- Maintain LLM-independent agents for adaptability.

#### Dynamic Agent Attributes
- Define agent attributes on the fly for fine-grained behavior control.
- Create better agent definitions for improved task performance.

#### Personas
- Enable or disable agent personification.
- Create custom characters, personalities, and traits.

#### Tools
Build and integrate modular tools like Selenium, APIs, or custom utilities.

#### Connections
Manage seamless interactions between agents and external systems.

#### RAGs
Create Retrieval-Augmented Generations (RAGs) with minimal setup.

#### Prompt modelling and management framework

Define and design prompts within a object oriented framework. Keep track of prompts and responses in promptDB
Improve LLM respones through clever prompt engineering frameworks

#### Define proper agent schema and validation

Leverage integration with pydantic for proper agent schema validation

#### Monitoring dashboard
